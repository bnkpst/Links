## USYD Crypto Course
https://elec5616.com/
```
In this semester one USYD course, we start by examining the basic cryptographic building blocks of security, working through to their applications in authentication, key exchange, secret and public key encryption, digital signatures, protocols and systems. We then examine these applications in the real world, analysing practical cryptosystems, the assumptions with which they were designed, their limitations, failure modes, and ultimately why most end up broken.
